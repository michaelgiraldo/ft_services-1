# ft_services
***This is a System Administration and Networking project. It introduces us to cluster management and deployment with Kubernetes.***

## Technical considerations

- Must use Kubernetes
- Set up a multi-service cluster. Each service run in a dedicated container
- Containers to be built using Alpine Linux
- Dockerfile needs to be built. Forbidden to use docker images from DockerHub
